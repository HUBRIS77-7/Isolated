# Maps

Everything the unit can walk on lives here. A map is plain text — one character
per tile — so it reads fine in a diff and can be edited by hand or with the
editor.

## Making one

Open **`editor.html`** in a browser (no server needed). Draw, then
**Download .js** and drop the file into this folder. Register it by adding one
line to `index.html` next to the others:

```html
<script src="maps/tiles.js"></script>
<script src="maps/tutorial.js"></script>
<script src="maps/my-new-map.js"></script>   <!-- this -->
```

Play it with `index.html?map=my-new-map`. While you are still drawing, the
editor's **Playtest** button opens the game on your unsaved draft
(`index.html?draft=1`) — no download or script tag needed.

The editor keeps your work in `localStorage`, so closing the tab does not lose
it. **Open file…** loads any map back in for another pass.

## The format

```js
ISO.register({
  "id": "tutorial",                  // filename and ?map= value
  "name": "Landing Site — Node 77",  // shown nowhere yet; for your own use
  "w": 41, "h": 27,
  "spawn": {"x": 26, "y": 22},       // where the unit starts
  "beacons": [{"x": 7, "y": 8}],     // tutorial beacon spots; one is picked at
                                     // random. If empty, the game picks any
                                     // reachable tile ≥6 steps away. Elevator
                                     // tiles count as beacon spots too.
  "props": {                         // per-instance settings, keyed "x,y"
    "48,13": {"targets": [{"x": 47, "y": 12},
                          {"x": 47, "y": 13}], "label": "LANDING"}
  },
  "rows": ["  ,,,.....  ", ...]      // exactly h strings of exactly w chars
});
```

## Tiles

| Char | Tile      | Walk | Notes                                        |
|------|-----------|------|----------------------------------------------|
| ` `  | Unmapped  | no   | Negative space — gives a map its shape        |
| `.`  | Floor     | yes  |                                              |
| `,`  | Debris    | yes  |                                              |
| `=`  | Plating   | yes  |                                              |
| `+`  | Doorway   | yes  |                                              |
| `#`  | Wall      | no   |                                              |
| `%`  | Bulkhead  | no   | Sealed until a button drives it open         |
| `~`  | Sludge    | yes  | Logs a line the first time it is crossed     |
| `!`  | Hazard    | yes  | Logs a warning the first time                |
| `o`  | Relay     | no   |                                              |
| `x`  | Fencing   | no   | Blocks like a wall; you can see through it   |
| `v`  | Pit       | yes  | Walk in and the run ends. `[R]` re-initialises |
| `T`  | Tram      | yes  | Platform that a button calls along a rail    |
| `b`  | Button    | no   | `[E]` from an adjacent tile signals its targets |
| `c`  | Terminal  | no   | `[E]` opens a small window of text           |
| `^`  | Elevator  | yes  | A beacon you place as a tile                 |

To add a tile type, add one entry to `TILES` in `tiles.js`. It shows up in the
editor palette on its own and the game obeys it straight away — walkability,
colour, glyph and the line it writes to the message log all come from there.

## Blocks that need setting up

A block that has to be configured copy by copy declares a `props` schema in its
`TILES` entry. Each placed copy keeps its own values under `map.props["x,y"]`,
and the editor builds its inspector straight from that schema — a new setting
costs one line in `tiles.js` and nothing anywhere else.

| Block    | Setting        | Means                                          |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Button   | `targets`      | The blocks this button signals — any number    |
| Button   | `label`        | Name shown in the message log                  |
| Bulkhead | `open`         | Starts open rather than sealed                 |
| Tram     | `dir`, `dist`  | Which way the platform runs, and how far       |
| Terminal | `title`, `text`| What the small window says                     |
| Terminal | `desktop`      | This console has a desktop behind it (not built yet) |

In the editor, pick the **Link** tool (`L`) and click a block: its settings
appear under **INSTANCE**. Wire a button up with **Pick ▸**, then click the
block it drives. The picker stays open, so keep clicking to wire a whole bank
to the one control — click a block a second time to drop it, `Esc` when done.
Each link is listed under the button with an `×` beside it. Painting a block
that takes settings selects it straight away, and painting over one throws its
settings out with it.

The canvas draws the wiring while you work: amber from each button to every
block it drives, and a pale line along the rail each platform runs.

One press signals all of them at once — a bank of bulkheads opens together, and
a button may drive bulkheads and call a platform in the same press. Each block
answers for itself, so two bulkheads left in opposite states swap rather than
line up. The message log collapses the identical lines, so a bank of four reads
as one.

A map written before a button could drive more than one block still loads: its
single `target` is read as a list of one.

Buttons and terminals do not block signals — they block the unit, so put them
in a wall next to a tile it can stand on. A tram's rail may run over unmapped
space or a pit; the platform is the floor while it is there, and bare rail
when it is not.

The editor's **Survey** panel flags the things that break a map: a spawn inside
a wall, a beacon that cannot be reached, ground sealed off from the rest
(tinted red on the canvas), a button that signals nothing, a terminal with no
text, a bulkhead no button opens, a tram whose rail runs into a wall.
