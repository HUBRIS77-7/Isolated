# Maps

Everything the unit can walk on lives here. A map is plain text — one character
per tile — so it reads fine in a diff and can be edited by hand or with the
editor.

## Making one

Open **`editor.html`** in a browser (no server needed). Draw, then
**Download .js** and drop the file into this folder. Register it by adding one
line to `index.html` next to the others:

```html
<script src="maps/tiles.js"></script>
<script src="maps/tutorial.js"></script>
<script src="maps/my-new-map.js"></script>   <!-- this -->
```

Play it with `index.html?map=my-new-map`. While you are still drawing, the
editor's **Playtest** button opens the game on your unsaved draft
(`index.html?draft=1`) — no download or script tag needed.

The editor keeps your work in `localStorage`, so closing the tab does not lose
it. **Open file…** loads any map back in for another pass.

## The format

```js
ISO.register({
  "id": "tutorial",                  // filename and ?map= value
  "name": "Landing Site — Node 77",  // shown nowhere yet; for your own use
  "w": 41, "h": 27,
  "spawn": {"x": 26, "y": 22},       // where the unit starts
  "beacons": [{"x": 7, "y": 8}],     // tutorial beacon spots; one is picked at
                                     // random. If empty, the game picks any
                                     // reachable tile ≥6 steps away. Elevator
                                     // tiles count as beacon spots too.
  "props": {                         // per-instance settings, keyed "x,y"
    "48,13": {"targets": [{"x": 47, "y": 12},
                          {"x": 47, "y": 13}], "label": "LANDING"}
  },
  "rows": ["  ,,,.....  ", ...]      // exactly h strings of exactly w chars
});
```

| `o`  | Relay     | no   |                                              |
| `x`  | Fencing   | no   | Blocks like a wall; you can see through it   |
| `v`  | Pit       | yes  | Walk in and the run ends. `[R]` re-initialises |
| `T`  | Tram      | yes  | Platform that a button calls along a rail    |
| `b`  | Button    | no   | `[E]` from an adjacent tile signals its targets |
| `c`  | Terminal  | no   | `[E]` opens a small window of text           |
| `^`  | Elevator  | yes  | A beacon you place as a tile                 |
| `L`  | Locker    | no   | Decoration                                   |
| `B`  | Box       | no   | Decoration                                   |
| `A`  | Filing cabinet | no | Decoration                                 |
| `/`  | Broken wall | yes | Reads as wall, but the gap is walkable      |
| `C`  | Cargo container | no | Touching copies become one container — as big as you paint it |
| `F`  | Forklift  | no   | Two tiles long; turns with its `dir`         |
| `D`  | Desk      | no   | Three tiles long; turns with its `dir`       |
| `G`  | Cargo gate | no  | Sealed. `[E]` drives it, and so does a button. Touching copies open together, and `locked` makes one nothing will open |
| `V`  | Vent      | yes  | `[E]` crawls through to the square it is linked to |

To add a tile type, add one entry to `TILES` in `tiles.js`. It shows up in the
editor palette on its own and the game obeys it straight away — walkability,
colour, glyph and the line it writes to the message log all come from there.

## Blocks that need setting up

A block that has to be configured copy by copy declares a `props` schema in its
`TILES` entry. Each placed copy keeps its own values under `map.props["x,y"]`,
and the editor builds its inspector straight from that schema — a new setting
costs one line in `tiles.js` and nothing anywhere else.

| Block    | Setting        | Means                                          |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Button   | `targets`      | The blocks this button signals — any number    |
| Button   | `label`        | Name shown in the message log                  |
| Bulkhead | `open`         | Starts open rather than sealed                 |
| Tram     | `dir`, `dist`  | Which way the platform runs, and how far       |
| Terminal | `title`, `text`| What the small window says                     |
| Terminal | `desktop`      | This console has a desktop behind it (not built yet) |
| Forklift | `dir`          | Which way it faces, so which tile its second half covers |
| Desk     | `dir`          | Which way it runs                              |
| Cargo gate | `open`       | Starts open rather than sealed                 |
| Cargo gate | `locked`     | Nothing drives it — no control, no `[E]`       |
| Vent     | `dest`         | The square it comes out at                     |
| Vent     | `label`        | Name shown in the message log                  |

In the editor, pick the **Link** tool (`L`) and click a block: its settings
appear under **INSTANCE**. Wire a button up with **Pick ▸**, then click the
block it drives. The picker stays open, so keep clicking to wire a whole bank
to the one control — click a block a second time to drop it, `Esc` when done.
Each link is listed under the button with an `×` beside it. Painting a block
that takes settings selects it straight away, and painting over one throws its
settings out with it.

Anything with a `dir` — a forklift, a desk, a platform — also turns with
**`R`** while it is selected, which is quicker than reaching for the dropdown
while laying out a room.

The canvas draws the wiring while you work: amber from each button to every
block it drives, and a pale line along the rail each platform runs.

One press signals all of them at once — a bank of bulkheads opens together, and
a button may drive bulkheads and call a platform in the same press. Each block
answers for itself, so two bulkheads left in opposite states swap rather than
line up. The message log collapses the identical lines, so a bank of four reads
as one.

A map written before a button could drive more than one block still loads: its
single `target` is read as a list of one.

## Blocks bigger than one tile

A map is still one character per tile. A block that covers more than one works
two ways, because the two read differently to whoever is drawing:

**It states its own size** (`foot` in `tiles.js`). You paint one tile — the
anchor — and the block works out the rest from its own `dir`: a forklift is
always two tiles, a desk always three. Turning it moves the tiles it covers,
so rotating a desk is a change of setting rather than a redraw. The far half
is as solid as the tile you painted, and walking into it reads the whole
block's name.

**It is as big as you paint it** (`merge`). Tiles of the same kind that touch
draw as one body, with the seams between them left out and the block's glyph
repeated across every tile of it — so a container reads as crating and a gate
as slats at any size. A cargo container is however many tiles you gave it, and
the log says what size the unit found — *Cargo container. Hull seals read
intact. 3 × 2 units.* A cargo gate works the same way, so a gate four tiles
tall opens as one door, whether the unit drives it or a button does.

Survey flags a big block that reaches past the edge of the record, stands in a
wall, or overlaps another one.

## Two ways into the same block

A cargo gate answers a button the way a bulkhead does, and answers `[E]` from
an adjacent tile on its own — so it needs no control, and Survey does not ask
for one. A gate set **`locked`** answers nothing at all: not `[E]`, not a
control wired to it, and the log says so rather than pretending. A body is
locked if any tile of it is, because the body is one door — Survey says as much
when a body's tiles are set differently. Survey also stops treating a locked
gate as a way through, so ground behind one is reported sealed off (and tinted
red) the way a wall would be, and it points out a control wired to a gate that
can never answer it. `locked` with `open` is the other useful pair: an opening
nothing will ever shut.

A vent needs no control either: `[E]` from the cover, or from standing
on it, and the unit comes out at the square the vent is linked to. Link the far
end with **Pick ▸** under **INSTANCE**; point two vents at each other and the
route runs both ways. The canvas draws a dotted line to wherever each vent
comes out.

Buttons and terminals do not block signals — they block the unit, so put them
in a wall next to a tile it can stand on. A tram's rail may run over unmapped
space or a pit; the platform is the floor while it is there, and bare rail
when it is not.

The editor's **Survey** panel flags the things that break a map: a spawn inside
a wall, a beacon that cannot be reached, ground sealed off from the rest
(tinted red on the canvas), a button that signals nothing, a terminal with no
text, a bulkhead no button opens, a tram whose rail runs into a wall, a vent
with no far end or one that comes out inside a wall, and a forklift or desk
with nowhere to stand.
